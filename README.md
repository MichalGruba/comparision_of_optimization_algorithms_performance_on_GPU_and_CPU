# Comparision_of_optimization_algorithms_performance_on_GPU_and_CPU

The program includes implementation of 2 optimization algorithms:
- Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm
- Spiral Optimization Algorithm
on both CPU and GPU.

At the start of the program user is asked to provide number of particles searching for the minimum and number
of iterations of each algorithm as well as choice of saving the positions of particles at every iteration to txt file
in order to visualize the optimization process in MATLAB.
